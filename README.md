Suppose you are developing a portal for reant a car companies. Companies have already been registered and have added their vehicles and basic mileage rates from one destination to another. Below is a form in which they are required for adding uplift amounts if another vehicle other than their base vehicle is selected.

There are two options for each vehicle type one is for percentage uplift one is for flat amount.

You are required to implement the form validation for this. Conditions are as follows.

only one category can be selected for each vehicle type. e.g. if percentage is selected then flat amount will be disabled.
in percentage only number from 0-100 can be entered
in flat amount any positive number can be entered.
You are free to choose whatever library/framework of JS you like. You can even implement in plain JS.
